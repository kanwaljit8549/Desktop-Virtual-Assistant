# Desktop-Virtual-Assistant
Here, I have worked on this project of Desktop Virtual Assistant using python programming language and I have created some of the tasks that this virtual assistant can handle are listed below:-

------------------------
**How are you?** : Whenever you ask "how are you?" to the assistant it will reply with different random answers provided in the list.

**Time** : You can ask the assistant to "tell time" or "what is the time", however you say it, assistant automatically predicts that you are asking the time and it will speak for you.

**Open YouTube** : You can ask to "open youtube" and it will open the youtube website on the default browser in your computer.

**Open Google** : I have added two different codes for google first is just to "open google" website on the default web browser.

**Search Google** : This is the second code that works as "open google" and then it will ask you what you want to search on google, say it and it will open browser and search your query on google.

**Search WikiPidea** : This is the wikipedia search and you have to say your "query + wikipidea" it will speak and print the results of the query getting only two lines from the source.

**Send email** : You have to add your email and password first and whom you want to send email, then you can say "send email" and it will ask you what should the email content to send and it will send the email afterwards.

**Play Music** : After you say " play music" it will automatically play the songs present in the path you have given, randomly from the list in the music player.

**Open Apps** : You can add the path to applications you want to open by voice and can call them afterwards with specific keywords.

--------------------------
User can edit code and can open apps that he might wanted to open using speech recognition by editing a 2 line code in the program. User can add as much as applications he want to open from virtual assistant. It is the flexible code provided with suitable comments along with explanation inside the program. I am sure that who so ever will open this project is able to get what is happening inside the program of virtual assistant.
